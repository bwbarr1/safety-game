        <h1>Welcome to Safety Controls</h1>
        <p>In this short walkthrough you’ll learn the four control types you’ll use in the scenario game. Keep going until the end to unlock the game.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Direct Control</strong> — actions people take directly to avoid or reduce risk.</li>
          <li><strong>Engineering Control</strong> — risk reduced by design, equipment, or technology.</li>
          <li><strong>Administrative Control</strong> — policies, training, or procedures that guide safe behavior.</li>
          <li><strong>Better Than Nothing (BTN)</strong> — helps a bit, but doesn’t remove or meaningfully reduce the hazard.</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <article class="slide card" hidden>
        <h2>Direct Control</h2>
        <p>Direct controls are immediate actions a person takes to control a hazard: e.g., setting a parking brake, using turn indicators, or maintaining three points of contact.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Performed by the person at risk.</li>
          <li>Effectiveness depends on consistency and attention.</li>
          <li>Often the simplest, but also easiest to skip.</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <article class="slide card" hidden>
        <h2>Engineering Control</h2>
        <p>Engineering controls change the environment or equipment so the hazard is eliminated or exposure is reduced by design: e.g., machine guards, interlocks, airbags, lane assist.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Built into tools, equipment, or workspace layout.</li>
          <li>Works regardless of individual behavior.</li>
          <li>Preferred when feasible because it’s reliable and scalable.</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <article class="slide card" hidden>
        <h2>Administrative Control</h2>
        <p>Administrative controls are rules and guidance that influence how work is performed: e.g., SOPs, signage, permits to work, and training.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Relies on people following procedures.</li>
          <li>Often necessary but weaker than engineering solutions.</li>
          <li>Great when combined with other control types.</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <article class="slide card" hidden>
        <h2>Better Than Nothing (BTN)</h2>
        <p>BTN measures give some benefit but don’t remove the hazard or provide strong risk reduction: e.g., glancing in a mirror without a blind‑spot monitor, or a reminder note instead of a guard.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Can improve awareness, but limited protection.</li>
          <li>Use BTN only until a stronger control is available.</li>
          <li>Aim to upgrade BTN to Direct, Administrative, or Engineering controls.</li>
        </ul>
